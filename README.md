# Introduction

In our company we are using Doc2Data for transforming _structured machine-readable documents_ (Word, Excel, PDF)
to data structure within JSON file. This tool could be used as a Java library, command line tool or microservice
providing REST API.

Free version of the service that you could play with is available from https://d2d.work

## What you will find in this repository

This repository contains meta-mapping that could be used for some set of documents that you could find in the Internet.
As well you could find a good teaching base for creating meta-mapping files for your own _structured machine-readable
documents_.

Enjoy! :)
