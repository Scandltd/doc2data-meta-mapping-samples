# Introduction

We have created a quite nice tool that helps to transform _machine readable structure documents_ (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
to data structures as JSON. You could read more at https://scand.com (direct link will be provided later). This tool
could be used as a Java library, command line tool or microservice (distributed either as Spring Boot application or
Docker container).

Free version of the service that you could play with is available from https://d2d.work

## What you will find in this repository

This repository contains meta-mapping that could be used for some set of documents that you could find in the Internet.
As well you could find a good teaching base for creating your own meta-mapping files for your own _machine readable
structure documents_.

Enjoy! :)
